## My process

- I first went through the style guide for the project, to get the exact color codes, the relevant dimensions and measurements, and the fonts.
- I then proceeded to study the jpeg files in the asset folder, to get a broader understanding of how the finished work would look like.
- After getting a clear understanding of what was required, I proceeded to write the HTML markup and the necessary styles.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Though I have used most of the codes written in this project before, there are a few that I have never really had hands on experience with. One perfect example is the @font-face css at-rule. This isbecause, iusually import fonts with url, instead of downloading the font into my working directory. I'm glad that this project gave me the opportunity to actaully use it. Furthermore, this is my first ever readme file. And if not for this project, I wouldn't have written any readme document at this point. Below is a snippet of the @font-face at-rule highlighten on earlier.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: main-font;
  src: url("assets/fonts/static/DMSans-Regular.ttf");
}
```

### Continued development

At this point in my website development journey, I have gained a lot of knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, tailwindcss, and some knowledge in react, bootrtrap, node js, express, among others. however, I don't feel satisfied in my knowledge on react, so I think that is my next focus. I'll keep practicing what I have learned, while I search for more knowledge on grey areas in react.
